App Functionality:

***Option One***
Title: Make It - or - Buy It

Designed for users trying to decide whether to make their meal or buy it. When a user visits the website they are presented with a text box to input whatever food item they are currently craving. When the user hits the submit button, a recipe pertaining to that item is displayed on one side of the page and the other side displays a restaurant that carries that specific food item.
{if the restaurant API requires GPS location} - A second textbox where the user can enter their location will be displayed below the food input box. When the user hits the submit button, a restaurant that serves that food item in their area is displayed. The user must fill out both food and location boxes.
// Also can add a textbox for making or buying cocktails below the food textbox if we get this running smoothly.


***Option Two***
Title: Meal Maker

Designed for users looking to make their food and drinks. When a user visits the website, they are presented with a text box to input a food item they are craving at the moment and a second text box to enter what drink they would like to go with their meal. When the user hits the submit button for the first text box input, a recipe pertaining to that food item is displayed. When the user hits the submit button for the second text box input, a recipe pertaining to that drink item is displayed.
